# Healthcare Cost and Insurance Analytics with Predictive Modeling

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare costs and insurance data using advanced data science and visualization techniques. The goal is to derive actionable insights and build predictive models for cost estimation, with a particular emphasis on claims data, including medical, membership, and pharmacy details.

## Key Features
- **Data Integration and Cleaning**: Merged and preprocessed healthcare datasets, addressing missing values and ensuring data quality.
- **Tableau Dashboards**: Developed interactive dashboards to visualize trends in healthcare costs, hospital tiers, and claims data.
- **SQL Analysis**: Utilized SQL to query datasets, extracting insights related to hospitalization costs, patient demographics, and claims.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Implemented predictive models using Python to estimate hospitalization costs, leveraging machine learning techniques like Random Forest and XGBoost.
- **Hypothesis Testing**: Conducted statistical tests to analyze relationships between factors like smoking, heart issues, and cost variations.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Visualization**: Tableau, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Database**: SQL (PostgreSQL)
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, XGBoost, Linear Regression
- **Other Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Excel

## Key Deliverables
1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation**
   - Addressed missing values and standardized categorical variables.
   - Created dummy variables for selected states and hospital tiers.

2. **Visual Analytics**
   - Designed dashboards showcasing trends in costs by hospital tier, city, and gender.
   - Created radar charts and stacked bar charts to highlight insights.

3. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Built and validated machine learning models using stratified 5-fold cross-validation.
   - Used models to predict hospitalization costs with high accuracy.

4. **Statistical Analysis**
   - Tested hypotheses on cost differences by hospital and city types.
   - Assessed independence of smoking and heart-related issues.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate more granular claims data for deeper analysis.
- Integrate advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning models.
- Automate end-to-end data pipeline and model deployment.
